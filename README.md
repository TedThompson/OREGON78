# OREGON78
Applesoft BASIC port of the original Oregon Trail game from 1978

Originally published in Creative Computing May/June 1978 issue, the original code was written in BASIC on a CDC CYBER 70 mainframe computer. 

The code was published and with some work to compensate for some commands that Applesoft just didn't have, and a bit of reformatting to work on a 40col screen instead of an 80col printer(!) it ported very nicely.

I'm offering this as source code, Disk Image, and WAV file for use in emulators or real hardware.
